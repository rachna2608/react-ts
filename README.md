# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is the main container application built with Vite + React. It consumes and renders two separately deployed micro frontends (MFEs) using Module Federation via @originjs/vite-plugin-federation.

It uses Module Federation to dynamically load and render React components from the two MFEs at runtime. Each MFE is independently deployed and versioned, enabling modular development and faster deployments.
